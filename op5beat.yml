################### Op5beat Configuration Example #########################

############################# Op5beat ######################################

op5beat:
  # How often to query livestatus for data. The default is 30s.
  period: 30s

  # When Querying livestatus, how fresh should the last check be? The default is 30

  lastCheck: 30

  # The host and port where livestatus is listening.
  op5Host: "/opt/monitor/var/rw/live"

  # The connection type to use for livestatus (unix or tcp)
  op5Connect: "unix"

  # Which livestatus table to query
  query: "services"

  # The columns of data you want to retrieve. At a minimum, the following fields must be included:
  # ["host_name", "display_name", "state",  "plugin_output", "perf_data"]
  columns: ["host_name", "display_name", "state", "plugin_output", "long_plugin_output", "percent_state_change", "perf_data"]

  # (Optional) An array of filters to apply to the query.
  # By default a query must pass all filters, but 'And: x' or 'Or: x' commands can be used,
  # where x specifies the number of previous filter lines to apply the operator to.
  # Ex. ["state = 1", "state = 3", "Or: 2" ] matches anything with a state of 1 OR 3.
  #filter: ["checks_enabled = 1", "host_state = 0"]

  # Whether or not to split up the perfdata into individual metrics. This will create additional fields such as
  # [cpu][value], [cpu][min], [cpu][max], etc. for each parameter in the performance data. Default is true.
  #metrics: true

  # If enabled, only perfdata for the specified services will be reported. Default is to include metrics for all services.
  #metrics_allow: ["CPU Utilization", "Disk IO", "Memory", "Interface"]

  # If enabled, perfdata for the specified services will not be reported. Default is to include metrics for all services.
  #metrics_block: ["Uptime", "System Time", "Check_MK", "Log"]

  # Whether to report just the 'value' field of the perfdata metrics, or whether to include the min / max / warn / crit
  # fields as well. Default is true.
  #metrics_value_only: true

#================================ General =====================================

# The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
# all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
#name:

# The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
# transaction published.
#tags: ["service-X", "web-tier"]

# Optional fields that you can specify to add additional information to the
# output.
#fields:
#  env: staging


#============================== Dashboards =====================================
# These settings control loading the sample dashboards to the Kibana index. Loading
# the dashboards is disabled by default and can be enabled either by setting the
# options here or by using the `setup` command.
#setup.dashboards.enabled: false

# The URL from where to download the dashboards archive. By default this URL
# has a value which is computed based on the Beat name and version. For released
# versions, this URL points to the dashboard archive on the artifacts.elastic.co
# website.
#setup.dashboards.url:

#============================== Kibana =====================================

# Starting with Beats version 6.0.0, the dashboards are loaded via the Kibana API.
# This requires a Kibana endpoint configuration.
setup.kibana:

  # Kibana Host
  # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 5601)
  # In case you specify and additional path, the scheme is required: http://localhost:5601/path
  # IPv6 addresses should always be defined as: https://[2001:db8::1]:5601
  #host: "localhost:5601"

  # Kibana Space ID
  # ID of the Kibana Space into which the dashboards should be loaded. By default,
  # the Default Space will be used.
  #space.id:

#============================= Elastic Cloud ==================================

# These settings simplify using Op5beat with the Elastic Cloud (https://cloud.elastic.co/).

# The cloud.id setting overwrites the `output.elasticsearch.hosts` and
# `setup.kibana.host` options.
# You can find the `cloud.id` in the Elastic Cloud web UI.
#cloud.id:

# The cloud.auth setting overwrites the `output.elasticsearch.username` and
# `output.elasticsearch.password` settings. The format is `<user>:<pass>`.
#cloud.auth:

#================================ Outputs =====================================

# Configure what output to use when sending the data collected by the beat.

#-------------------------- Elasticsearch output ------------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  # Array of hosts to connect to.
  hosts: ["localhost:9200"]

  # Optional protocol and basic auth credentials.
  #protocol: "https"
  #username: "elastic"
  #password: "changeme"

#----------------------------- Logstash output --------------------------------
#output.logstash:
  # The Logstash hosts
  #hosts: ["localhost:5044"]

  # Optional SSL. By default is off.
  # List of root certificates for HTTPS server verifications
  #ssl.certificate_authorities: ["/etc/pki/root/ca.pem"]

  # Certificate for SSL client authentication
  #ssl.certificate: "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"

  # Client Certificate Key
  #ssl.key: "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"

#================================ Processors =====================================

# Configure processors to enhance or manipulate events generated by the beat.

processors:
  - add_host_metadata: ~
  - add_cloud_metadata: ~

#================================ Logging =====================================

# Sets log level. The default log level is info.
# Available log levels are: error, warning, info, debug
#logging.level: debug

# At debug level, you can selectively enable logging only for some components.
# To enable all selectors use ["*"]. Examples of other selectors are "beat",
# "publish", "service".
#logging.selectors: ["*"]

#============================== Xpack Monitoring ===============================
# op5beat can export internal metrics to a central Elasticsearch monitoring
# cluster.  This requires xpack monitoring to be enabled in Elasticsearch.  The
# reporting is disabled by default.

# Set to true to enable the monitoring reporter.
#monitoring.enabled: false

# Sets the UUID of the Elasticsearch cluster under which monitoring data for this
# Op5beat instance will appear in the Stack Monitoring UI. If output.elasticsearch
# is enabled, the UUID is derived from the Elasticsearch cluster referenced by output.elasticsearch.
#monitoring.cluster_uuid:

# Uncomment to send the metrics to Elasticsearch. Most settings from the
# Elasticsearch output are accepted here as well.
# Note that the settings should point to your Elasticsearch *monitoring* cluster.
# Any setting that is not set is automatically inherited from the Elasticsearch
# output configuration, so if you have the Elasticsearch output configured such
# that it is pointing to your Elasticsearch monitoring cluster, you can simply
# uncomment the following line.
#monitoring.elasticsearch:

#================================= Migration ==================================

# This allows to enable 6.7 migration aliases
#migration.6_to_7.enabled: true
